It was caused by a DRP glow test, which simulated the largest region failing at the time of the highest traffic. The incident was caused by machines running out of memory and crashing, and the system health checks were affected by the load shedding, causing traffic oscillations between regions. To prevent this from happening again, the team made an explicit choice to spread traffic evenly across all machines, changed the health checks to look at the short term history, and adjusted the weights of the CDN design. They also built automation to support tier isolation and invested in stronger container level isolation and resource limits.[0m

[33m4.058s[0m [1mresponse.Data.Output[0m=[36m- Metastable failures are a class of failures where a system fails under increased load and cannot recover due to a sustaining effect.
       - The three attributes of metastable failures are: a trigger that causes the system to enter a bad state, the system is unusable while in the bad state, and a sustaining effect that prevents self-recovery.
       - Metastable failures and cascading failures are distinct, though there is overlap. Metastable failures imply the system has the potential to self-recover but does not during the failure.
       - Disabling health checks and spreading traffic evenly across all machines, even unhealthy ones, can break the sustaining effect and allow recovery from a metastable failure.
       - Load shedding by disabling health checks forced a normal traffic spread, avoiding overloading healthy instances.
       - Health checks can be affected by load shedding, causing traffic oscillations.
       - The system was able to serve stale cached content during the failure, reducing data loss.
       - Changes were made to health checks, region weights, tier isolation, and auto-scaling to prevent a similar incident.
       - Spreading traffic across all services, even failing ones, can avoid overloading surviving services and cascading failures.
       - Understanding how your system will behave under failure can help with recovery and remediation.[0m

       - Adaptive capacity is the ability of a system to change how it operates in response to evolving conditions. Resilience reflects this need for sustained adaptation.
       - Humans are the primary adaptive capability in software systems. They act as the mechanism for adaptation in response to failures and surprises.
       - Chaos experiments can help uncover interactions in systems by revealing how reality differs from our mental models. This helps us continuously improve system design.
       - Security chaos engineering uses experiments to verify that systems operate as expected and improve resilience to attacks.
       - Decision trees can help visualize our mental models and refine them over time. They map potential failures and mitigations.
       - Experiments inform decision trees and vice versa, forming a feedback loop to continuously improve resilience.
       - Decision trees are useful during incident reviews to identify gaps in assumptions and mental models.
       - Starting with the most obvious and expected failures in decision trees allows you to continuously verify resilience to low-hanging fruit issues.
       - Few organizations ever tackle the most esoteric and unlikely failures. Focus should be on the more common and expected issues first.[0m

       - Using streaming services like Kafka decouples state from Honeycomb's systems, allowing them to release software updates every hour.
       - Kafka provides ordering of data, which helps Honeycomb keep copies of data consistent and able to recover from failures.
       - Problems with Honeycomb's Kafka-based system can arise from producers, consumers, or brokers. It's important to identify which is the issue to properly address it.
       - Batching events when producing to Kafka can improve compression ratio and limit data loss if a producer crashes.
       - Honeycomb does not use Kafka as a permanent data store, instead persisting data to S3. This limits how far back they need to replay data after an outage.
       - Profiling and stress testing Honeycomb's Kafka cluster helped identify optimizations and limits to hardware and software.
       - Honeycomb monitors application-level metrics and traces to correlate issues with Kafka performance.

        - Financial services websites also face challenges handling spikes in traffic during market swings and news events.
        - Beacon is an in-house service Morgan Stanley created to intelligently route traffic to either replica databases or primary databases based on latency.
        - Beacon 1.0 had some operational burdens as it sampled latency from only one database per module. This required manual overrides when there were replication issues.
        - Beacon 2.0 improved on this by tracking latency for each domain database separately. This allows Beacon to operate independently for each domain.
        - Beacon is configured to intercept requests and route them based on key values extracted from the requests.
        - Metrics show that Beacon is able to route over 75% of traffic to replica databases during market open, reducing load on primary databases.
        - Morgan Stanley focuses on areas beyond markets like supporting entrepreneurs and education programs.
        - Whyjun, the creator of Beacon, worked with Jason to improve and implement Beacon 2.0.

        - Change is dangerous and often breaks things, but we cannot stop change. Certificates expire, time moves on regardless of code freezes.
        - We only see part of the system from our limited perspective, lacking a global view. This leads to hidden interactions and issues we are unaware of.
        - Increasing robustness and adding controls to prevent failures makes systems more complex over time. But we lack the resources to properly reduce complexity.
        - Effective communication and coordination between teams is difficult due to partial understanding of systems and work that is ephemeral and invisible.
        - We have to navigate constraints like finite resources, unstoppable change, complexity and lack of global view to do our work effectively.
        - We cannot eliminate constraints but can get better at working within them. Treating operational skills as first-class is important.

        - The modeling process forces you to think through and clarify your understanding of how the system is supposed to work and identify gaps in that understanding.
        - The model checker can then determine if your model matches reality by finding inconsistencies and counter examples. This helps identify the root cause of issues.
        - The key is to create a simplified but accurate model that focuses only on the relevant details for the particular incident or problem.
        - For the Cosmos DB incident, modeling revealed that the failure to share session tokens between the dispatcher and worker processes led to inconsistent views of the data.
        - The mitigation deployed during the incident did not actually fix the underlying design issue - it just worked around one consequence of the problem.
        - Simplifying the system into a model that a human can understand helps get past the layers of abstraction and complexity in the real code.
        - The modeling process and results can be shared with others to confirm and improve the understanding of the system and incident.
        - Formal modeling tools like TLA+ allow considering all possible states and branching possibilities in a logical and mechanical way that is beyond human capabilities.
        - The resulting models can then be used to reason about potential fixes and design changes before implementing them in the real system.[0m

       - DDoS attacks can manifest in different ways and require service-specific context to identify. Metrics and logs need to be hardened to reliably detect attacks.
       - Graceful degradation means each part of the stack has awareness to reduce resource consumption during attacks. This allows services to continue functioning in a degraded state.
       - Default rules with general blocking criteria can be deployed locally to protect services when automatic detection fails. This prevents services from going down completely.
       - Client reputation can be used to de-prioritize requests from untrusted sources, allowing important requests to continue processing.
       - Requests should be blocked as early as possible to minimize impact during attacks.

       - The effectiveness of CDNs and ISPs in absorbing massive attacks has led to a drop in perceived effectiveness, as a small percentage of traffic that slips through can still take a system offline.
       - Scaling out at the Ingress point is not a viable strategy for surviving large DDoS attacks, and investing in service hardening and graceful degradation is necessary.
       - Dos attacks can have different motivations and characteristics, including being used as a distraction or for social engineering.
       - Filtering metrics to exclude suspicious traffic can hide increases in volume but not latency, leading to a blind spot in detecting bot traffic.
       - Simulations and testing algorithms before going live can help in understanding how systems will work together during DDoS attacks.
       - Blocking traffic at the top layer can protect against overwhelming traffic, but it can also result in serving error pages and degraded user experience.
       - Developing a rule engine and deploying blocking rules can help in identifying and mitigating attacks, but it can be a manual and time-consuming process.
       - Automating the detection and response to attacks is crucial to protect systems, and default rules can be deployed with the service itself to provide initial protection.

[33m9.096s[0m [1mresponse.Data.Output[0m=[36mPat Someru, a production engineer at Meadow, presented a talk on how to store and query profiler data in a better way. Profiler data is observational data on software and systems, and is often generated by tools like perf lib BPI for your kit. By storing profiler data in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), the data footprint can be reduced by roughly five orders of magnitude. The DAG consists of stack nodes, which are counts of times that a stack node data has been seen at a location in a stack for a particular binary. Stack node data has relatively low cardinality, which enables finding regressions across binaries via static SQL queries. Pat demonstrated this by updating demo.c to have do logging make simulate work do 10 times as much work as it would previously do. He then used the CLI of Stow, an open source implementation of the techniques discussed, to run a profiler and ingest the data output into a database. The results showed that do logging was taking up way more runtime than expected. This talk highlighted the benefits of treating the call graph as a graph, and how it can be used to make call graphs easily storable and queryable.[0m

        - Profiler data consists of stack snapshots showing what code is running on a system. This data is used to understand system performance.
        - Profiler data can generate large amounts of data quickly, making storage and querying difficult. The speaker had a case where 2GB of profiler data was generated in 10 seconds.
        - The speaker proposes storing profiler data in a DAG to reduce its footprint. They implement this in a tool called Stow.
        - The DAG model is based on stack nodes, stack node data, and executable IDs to represent the call graph structure.
        - Storing stack node data as hashed integers helps reduce data size and enables finding code regressions across binaries.

        - Flame graphs are a way to view performance data, showing the relative presence of frames in a collection of stack snapshots.
        - Storing and querying profiler data can become difficult, especially at large scales where data can reach the size of a third of a petabyte per day.
        - Storing profiler data in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) can significantly reduce its footprint by roughly five orders of magnitude.
        - The tool Stow, which implements storing profiler data in a DAG, can optimize data footprint and improve queryability.
        - Stack nodes, which are counts of times that a stack node data has been seen at a location in a stack for a particular binary, are the vertices of the graph in the DAG model.

It also uses an Adaptive algorithm called AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) to adjust the limit up and down based on the current set of conditions. Additionally, the system uses partitions to assign a percentage of the Global limit to sets of incoming use cases.

[33m23.227s[0m [1mresponse.Data.Output[0m=[36m- There is a lot of confusion and debate around terms like SRE, DevOps, and platform engineering. They are often poorly defined and people have different understandings of what they mean.
        - Many of these roles and approaches are essentially doing the same thing - keeping systems running - they just have different names and tools.
        - People's identities become tied to these buzzwords and approaches, but they may not actually be that meaningful or well-defined.
        - Platforms exist because there is a need to build, run and manage services at scale. They did not come first, the need came first.
        - Organizations still need to operate systems and deal with operations issues, even with platforms and abstractions. Someone has to take responsibility for keeping things running.
        - People become dependent on how others define these roles and approaches in order to define themselves.
        - People are told they need to adopt many practices to be successful, like CI/CD, SLOs, microservices, etc. but there is no one right answer.
        - People should not tie their identities to specific tasks, as those tasks will inevitably change over time.
        - People can "escape hell" by not basing their identities on what others tell them and by taking their own actions.
        - The important thing is keeping systems running, the specific roles and approaches are less important.[0m

[33m24.471s[0m [1mresponse.Data.Output[0m=[36mAlex Hidalgo, the Principal Reliability Advocate at Noble Nine, discussed the idea that "hell is other platforms" at SREcon23 Americas. He discussed how platforms exist because of necessity, and how people become dependent on the definitions of others when it comes to understanding themselves and their platforms. He also discussed how people can become traumatically bonded to their platforms, and how they can escape this "hell" if they are brave enough to take action and make their own meaningful decisions. He concluded by saying that it doesn't matter what title or buzzword you use to define yourself, but that it is important to be brave enough to step through the door and escape the "hell" of other platforms.[0m

[33m24.535s[0m [1mresponse.Data.Output[0m=[36m- The concept of hell in Jean-Paul Sartre's play "No Exit" is used as a metaphor for platforms and the challenges they present.
        - Hell is depicted as a comfortable sitting room, rather than a place of torture, which surprises the characters.
        - The speaker, Alex Hidalgo, apologizes for the death of DevOps and asserts that SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) is also dead.
        - The speaker discusses the evolution of terms and concepts in the field of operations, such as DevOps, SRE, and platform engineering.
        - The dependence on others' definitions and opinions is highlighted as a source of frustration and confusion in the industry.
        - The speaker emphasizes the need for individuals to take agency and make their own decisions, rather than relying solely on others' guidance.
        - The play's theme of dependence on others is compared to the reliance on platforms and the challenges of operating complex systems.
        - The speaker discusses the challenges and traumas experienced by operators and the difficulty of letting go of a sense of identity tied to a particular organization.
        - The importance of understanding and adapting to complex systems is emphasized, as well as the constant evolution of system administration.
        - The speaker concludes by encouraging individuals to be brave and take the necessary steps to escape the challenges and limitations of the current state of operations.[0m
