       Tanner Lund, Indeed
       
       Outage pattern analysis is hard! There have been many attempts to learn across multiple incidents. Folks look for categories, tags, causes, etc. to identify what's brittle or risky in their system, sometimes even using statistical models to help make sense of the data. However, their results often prove unsatisfying, non-actionable, or don't tell you anything you didn't already know from other sources.
       
       An alternate approach is to find patterns via Christopher Alexander's "Pattern-Centered Inquiry". Complex systems fail according to certain patterns or fundamental laws. We can identify and learn from these patterns and then see how their individual, diverse manifestations in our systems develop and manifest. An understanding of patterns and how to spot them then underpins better informed reliability decision making.

[33m0.001s[0m [1mresponse.Data.Output[0m=[36m- Learning across incidents is challenging due to inconsistencies in data collection and the difficulty of extracting meaningful insights through statistical analysis alone.
       - Pattern recognition is a powerful human ability that can help identify recurring themes and issues across incidents without extensive statistical analysis.
       - Experts have valuable tacit knowledge about recurring issues, workarounds, and effective responses that is not always documented but can be shared to help others through techniques like pairing.
       - Incident categorization can distract from meaningful learning by focusing debates on category definitions rather than underlying issues. Patterns are a better way to generalize learnings.
       - Fragmentation across organizational boundaries, like between teams or involving third parties, can impede coordination during incidents and limit awareness of available expertise.
       - Automation is prone to behaving in unintended ways if not carefully designed, as seen in examples of runaway processes from media.
       - Workarounds often emerge for valid reasons like process inefficiencies and should be analyzed to understand root causes rather than just eliminated.
       - Modeling sociotechnical systems requires accounting for human aspects like tradeoffs, incentives, and limitations of documentation.
       - Developing pattern languages through structured templates can help experts systematically share knowledge in a reusable form.
       - Involving those affected in problem analysis and solution design helps ensure feasibility and buy-in for action items.[0m

       MLOps is widely talked about and used to make the practice of deploying, managing, and monitoring ML models in production easier. Monitoring ML training or evaluation jobs is obviously very important however it is more important to monitor once an ML model is deployed.
       
       This talk first starts by giving a gentle introduction about how ML deployments should be monitored, briefly talking about edge cases in production, data drift, concept drift, model metrics as well as the standard system and resource metrics. We give the audience an overview of observability and monitoring in the context of MLOps. This monitoring could also provide valuable results in terms of whether a model should be retrained, if more data should be collected, if different kinds of data should be collected, and more.
       
       We show how one can handle the very important task of monitoring and performing the aforementioned tasks in the context of MLOps with Prometheus. We also show how one could take their existing deployments and add the power of easy and useful monitoring with Prometheus. Finally, we also show demos about how one could use Prometheus paired with their Flyte or Seldon Core, or FastAPI ML deployments.

       Batteries play a critical role in providing uninterrupted power during outages, but managing their lifecycle can be challenging and has environmental impact. In this presentation, we will introduce a sustainable solution for managing the lifecycle of batteries in data center infrastructure. Our solution employs IoT sensors, mechanism models, and AI models to monitor battery performance in real-time, analyze health, detect anomalies, and predict end-of-life. Real-time monitoring dashboards visualize battery performance and behaviors, while health analysis capabilities detect anomalies and predict failures. The solution recommends proactive maintenance to prevent costly downtime and triggers sustainable waste management processes. It reduces costs and environmental impact towards zero-carbon waste diversion goals. We will showcase real-world examples of our solution and how to improve waste diversion. The solution is deployed and running in production, supporting daily operations.

       Aashraya Sachdeva, Staff Engineer-ML, Observe.AI
       
       Contact centers are essential for customer support, but managing high call volumes can lead to agent stress and high attrition rates. Traditional methods of improving performance include supervisor oversight and post-call systems that use ML to analyze recordings for behavioral and communication issues. However, these approaches have limitations in knowledge retention and product/service knowledge. A real-time system is needed to guide agents during calls, but this presents engineering challenges in throughput vs latency and fault tolerance compared to post-call systems. Real-time ML systems also differ in terms of batch vs non-batched inference and context. The talk presents a real-time ML platform that scales horizontally and ensures low latency, discusses approaches to make the system robust and stable, and demonstrates its efficacy through implementation and load testing with up to 10,000 concurrent calls. Real-world evidence shows that such a system positively impacts business metrics.

       - The system was designed using a scheduler-agent-supervisor pattern to distribute workflows from calls to different ML processors in a reliable way.
       - ML processors use a pull-based model to only take on new workflows when they can meet latency KPIs to ensure consistent performance at scale.
       - Fault tolerance is achieved through graceful shutdown handling and automatic requeuing of workflows if instances fail ungracefully.
       - Scalability is addressed through techniques like load balancing, connection pooling, sharding of caches, and auto-scaling.
       - Latency, stability and infrastructure KPIs are monitored for observability.
       - Benchmarking is done through distributed load testing to validate performance at scale.
       - Optimizing for throughput vs latency depends on the use case criticality.
       - Characterizing resource needs (CPU, GPU etc.) of different ML models is important.
       - Segregating service and platform KPIs is needed for observability of the system and underlying infrastructure.[0m

And how secure and available is our domain? This talk is going to be a deep-dive on domain and DNS safety.
       
       The safety of our domains is an often overlooked and taken for granted, however, how many of us have really thought deeply about how to perform a threat and availability assessment of our domain and DNS infrastructure? This session will run through common availability and security threat vectors for domains and DNS and will demonstrate how to detect and mitigate them.

       In a brownfield, the transition to immutable infrastructure can take years of concentrated effort; leaving teams with a complex set of mutable infrastructure and technical debt that requires a robust set of tools and processes to support as the architecture evolves. Managing these tools and processes across a massive hybrid cloud spanning more than 5,000 compute instances across 12+ data centers and public cloud is a daunting prospect for any SRE team.
       
       I’ll share my story of evolving deployment infrastructure in this world from a developer-centric and push-oriented model to a distributed, eventually consistent, and pull-oriented model despite the challenges associated with traditional infrastructure and technical debt. I’ll also share what I’ll be keeping an eye out for in the future and how teams with similar problems but different environments can apply my design concepts to solve the problems and technical debt they face in their own work.

       The Linux Kernel lies at the heart of many high profile services and applications. And since the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level it is very important to keep up with kernel updates to ensure the production systems are patched in a timely manner for numerous security vulnerabilities discovered almost every day.
       
       Yet, because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many SREs, production engineers and system administrators try to avoid upgrading the kernel too often just for the sake of stability. In many companies we have seen a tendency to create more obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals, harder update justifications, requiring more time in canary testing etc). But introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any other software updates usually significantly increases the risk for the company and their service of being exploited.
       
       One of the reasons SREs and production engineers are too afraid of ANY kernel upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about Linux kernel release process and policy. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix release from a feature release. We also try to explore why commonly established perceptions and patterns around production kernel releases are wrong and how you actually risk the stability of your systems by not releasing the kernel regularly. In the end we describe how kernel releases are implemented in our company and propose possible approaches to deploy kernel upgrades regularly with minimal risk.

It is important to understand the workload and the kernel subsystems that are being used in order to make informed decisions about kernel upgrades. Kernel upgrades are inherently safer than other software updates, as they require a reboot and can be done gradually. It is important to patch early and often, and to apply bug fix releases with no question asked. Metrics monitoring and automation can help with human risk perception and provide quick and early signals about regressions.[0m

       - Kernel releases contain important bug and security fixes on a weekly basis, so it's important to apply these releases regularly to keep the system patched.
       - Delaying kernel upgrades increases the risk level over time as the amount of unapplied changes accumulates.
       - Metrics and automation can help evaluate kernel releases objectively and remove human bias from the process.
       - Major kernel versions are released every 9-10 weeks but receive bug fixes for 2-3 months, so it's best to move to the next long-term supported version.
       - Regressions are quite rare for kernel bug fix releases that only contain backported fixes.
       - Workload characteristics should be understood to test how new kernels may impact performance and functionality.
       - Standard software change processes can be followed for kernel upgrades since they are slower-paced due to reboots.
       - Long-term supported kernel versions provide a safer option for production with 2 years of bug fix support.
       - Understanding kernel internals helps focus testing on relevant subsystems to evaluate new versions efficiently.[0m

       Many observability tools only instrument popular open source frameworks. A common path to deeper visibility requires code modification with manual instrumentation. However, SRE’s don't always have the ability to directly modify applications they are responsible for supporting. This restriction is often in place due to separation of job responsibility, or because the application is provided by an external vendor.
       
       With configuration-based runtime instrumentation SRE’s can get visibility into applications without the need to recompile.
       
       In my talk, I'll share some heuristics I use to identify useful functions/methods that can be instrumented in unfamiliar applications. I will also showcase a tool I wrote to apply these heuristics in a Java codebase. Once these functions/methods are identified, attendees will learn to instrument them without any code modification using OpenTelemetry's Javaagent.

       There's one skill that has been a large part of the success I've had as an SRE and it has nothing to do with technical knowledge or understanding the inner workings of Kubernetes. It’s my soft skills and how I work with others. But what even are "soft skills"? How do you develop those skills if you don’t have them? How do you get better at "working with people"?
       
       This talk will use personal and professional anecdotes to explain the concepts behind "soft skills" and give you real usable advice and drills to develop these skills - regardless of whether you are an introvert or an extrovert. I’ll break it down and deliver it in context for technical professionals and walk through why I think these skills and concepts are such an integral part of the SRE discipline.

Soft skills are the companion to hard skills, and are difficult to measure. Self-awareness is key to understanding yourself and others, and is the foundation for working in teams. Examples were given of how to handle difficult conversations and situations, such as being mindful of language and emotions. It was also suggested that soft skills can be a competitive advantage, even for those who don't plan to be people managers. Lastly, it was highlighted that self-awareness is the secret weapon for SREs, as it can help to identify the people, processes, culture, and systems that are the real valuable insights to incidents.[0m

       - Developing self-awareness through introspection is key to understanding others and navigating complex social situations.
       - Introspection involves regularly reflecting on emotions, triggers, behaviors, and impacts through "emotion retrospectives".
       - Understanding one's own emotions, triggers, and behaviors lays the foundation for understanding others.
       - Handling difficult conversations and situations with care, empathy, factual language and acknowledging others' intent and perspective leads to better outcomes.
       - Speaking up appropriately and getting others to speak up as well requires self-awareness of one's impact and the team dynamics.
       - Soft skills give access to more opportunities and allow one to set themselves apart from other engineers.
       - Soft skills are important for SREs given the complexity of modern software systems and need for collaboration.
       - Soft skills take practice over time but can become an innate ability to navigate novel situations.
       - Humility, care for others, and ongoing introspection are needed along with soft skills.[0m

       - They initially started with an embedded SRE model to support 3 services directly.
       - As the organization grew, they transitioned to a specialized model with two teams - Chef and Diplomat - focusing on cross-cutting issues and individual services.
       - Further expansion led to each service taking more responsibility for SRE practices with guidance from the central SRE team.
       - Standardization of SRE practices and maturity assessments were implemented.
       - Success criteria and goals were defined to evaluate the SRE work.
       - The number of services doubled in a year while developers increased 5x, stretching SRE resources thin.
       - Metrics will now be used to identify issues and target embeded SRE support where needed.
       - Common infrastructure issues could lead to self-service implementations.
       - The overall goal is to increase agility and stability as the business expands rapidly.[0m

       - The company is facing challenges such as the expansion of cashless transactions, digitalization of payments, security measures, and new competitors.
       - To address these challenges, the company adopted a decimal concept, which involves building an independent team to quickly innovate and adapt.
       - The organization is expanding to a total of 20 teams with over 400 members.
       - The company created a digital enablement platform called JDEP on Google Cloud, which consists of cloud-native technologies.
       - The company launched an SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) team to introduce system reliability concepts and provide infrastructure support.
       - The SRE engagement model transitioned through three phases: launch, specialization, and expansion.
       - In the launch phase, an embedded SRE team provided full-time support for all services, but faced issues with meeting changing demands and lack of cross-organizational functions.
       - In the specialization phase, the SRE team was divided into two teams: a Sheriff team focused on best practices and problem-solving, and a Diplomat team focused on executing SRE for each service.
       - In the expansion phase, the SRE team shifted its mission from execution to promotion, enabling service teams to execute SRE practices themselves. Standardization, maturity assessment, and success criteria were implemented to evaluate and improve SRE practices.[0m

The organization has adapted a military and platform SRE engagement model to improve reliability. As the organization expanded, they transitioned to a specialization phase, where they spread their team into two gyms with different missions. Finally, they shifted their mission from SRE execution to SRE promotion, which involves standardizing SRE practices, defining SRE maturity assessment, and defining success criteria. This has enabled them to support 14 services and sub-streams to execute SRE practices by themselves. An interesting point is that they have implemented a culture of reliability in terms of how they respond to incidents and recover them, which is checked using technical practices such as gamma ray.[0m

       How do you arrange virtual machines, databases, and other services into logical groups?
       
       Whether with Google Cloud projects, AWS accounts, or Azure resource groups, my consulting customers find that either lumping all the resources together or parceling them out into tiny groups makes management, security, and cost analysis too difficult: It’s tough predicting the impact of a change.
       
       In this talk, related to my article at Usenix :login;, I’ll explain how I advise architects to make their infrastructure follow the logical boundaries of microservices and the organization.
       
       We'll see simple metrics that support the principles of high cohesion, low coupling; and high correlation between the stability of units and the fraction of inbound dependencies. To help in this, we'll review Ferent, a new open-source analysis tool that I developed in Clojure for measuring inter-project dependencies in Google Cloud.

       - Boundaries between groups should maximize cohesion within groups and minimize coupling between groups.
       - Some aspects like user interfaces are unstable and will change frequently, while core functions like authentication should be stable.
       - The ferrin tool can analyze dependencies between cloud resources like Google Cloud projects to detect cycles and measure stability.
       - Service account permissions indicate dependencies between projects since internal integrations use service accounts.
       - Architects should understand what parts of the system are likely to change and what parts are stable to design boundaries accordingly.

       Tanner Lund, Indeed
       
       Nobody's system works exactly the way they think it does. On top of that, systems of people and software are constantly changing, resulting in a regular need to update our limited understanding of how things actually work - where the sources of our success are, where our risks are, and how things behave.
       
       The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) is one way to study complex systems. It models them in terms of their functions, dependencies, and interactions - identifying variance in function outputs (which can be good too!) instead of a "success/failure" paradigm. This approach allows for a better understanding of how systems work and - importantly - how they interact.
       
       At the end of this session you should be able to understand such a model and evaluate whether it can help you better understand your own systems.

FRAM is based on the principles of caring about functions more than components, failure being equivalent to success, emergence, resonance, and control. FRAM diagrams consist of hexagons representing functions, with inputs, outputs, resources, preconditions, and control. Variability is also taken into account, with categories of internal, external, upstream, and downstream variability. FRAM diagrams can be used to identify weaknesses in a system and to understand how incidents occur. An interesting aspect of FRAM is that it can be used to model both software and people-based systems.[0m

       - Fram focuses on functions rather than components, as functions are the core elements of the modeling approach.
       - Failure is equivalent to success in Fram, as it focuses on the variability of function outputs and how they affect downstream functions.
       - Emergence is a principle in Fram, where behaviors can arise from connections between multiple system components.
       - Resonance, both stochastic and functional, is another principle in Fram, which refers to the variability in a function and how it affects connected functions.
       - Fram models are created by defining functions, identifying inputs and outputs, and connecting them together.
       - Resources and preconditions are important considerations in Fram, as they are necessary for functions to be carried out.
       - Variability in functions can be categorized as internal or external, and can have different effects on the system.
       - Incidents are valuable for understanding system dynamics and can help refine the Fram model.
       - Fram provides tools and software for creating and analyzing system diagrams, including the Dynafram research software for testing system fragility.[0m

       In the dynamic world of technology, where challenges abound, a strong and resilient infrastructure is pivotal. DBS’ framework is built on a set of techniques that acts as a catalyst embodying a collaborative, resilient and forward-thinking culture across the organisation. By shifting the focus from individuals to the system as a whole, our proactive approach termed as the ABCD and E’s of cultural transformation includes how everyone in the organisation should behave (by understanding the concept of AAI: Awareness, Acceptance, and Intention), how we can create a safe and secure environment, how we include data driven analysis to drive conversation, and how we encourage collaboration.

       Data is a valuable asset for organizations and its growth is exponential. However, storage device failures can result in data loss, service unavailability, and economic loss. Site Reliability Engineers face significant challenges managing and monitoring the millions or billions of storage devices deployed. Existing approaches to failure prediction have limitations in accuracy, performance, and cost-effectiveness. In this talk, we will present a practical, multi-phase proactive sampling-based approach and system that addresses these challenges. We will also provide a live demonstration of the system and practices in our data center, which has a multi-tiered cloud storage pool based on various storage devices. This talk aims to encourage practical storage failure prediction research to solve real-world challenges.

       Reducing cloud costs is one of the major concerns for tech companies today. One of the most cost effective ways to save on compute is to utilise Spot provisioning model. All major cloud vendors offer Spot Instances with up to 91% discount compared to on-demand prices and it’s tightly integrated in the respective vendor’s ecosystem, in particular in managed Kubernetes services like GKE, EKS and AKS. From our experience running a fleet of GKE clusters on Spot Instances, there’s much more to it than meets the eye. Losing capacity at a moment’s notice is only one part of the story and in this talk, we will delve into under-the-hood mechanisms of GKE Spot implementation, edge cases, and why teams collaboration and solid SRE principles are absolutely crucial in this environment.

Spot Instances are a provisioning model of compute resources with significant discounts, but no availability guarantee. To manage capacity, one can use a mix of spot and on-demand instances, reserve capacity, or use a managed commercial solution. Olga also discussed the known and unknown issues that can arise when running workloads on spot instances, such as overwhelming error statuses and confusing messages. Finally, she suggested replicating workloads, using graceful shutdown, and setting disruption budgets to ensure availability. An interesting point she made was that when a managed instance group identifies a signal that an instance was preempted, it will remove the instance from the group, but it can ask for capacity back, and when it succeeds, the node will continue leaving the cluster with the same name, but the VM will be different.[0m

       The industry defined as good practice to have as few alerts as possible, by alerting on symptoms that are associated with end-user pain rather than trying to catch every possible way that pain could be caused.
       
       Organizations with complex distributed systems that span dozens of teams can have a hard time following such practice without burning out the teams owning the client-facing services. A typical solution is to have alerts on all the layers of their distributed systems. This approach almost always leads to an excessive number of alerts and results in alert fatigue.
       
       Adaptive Paging is an alert handler that leverages the causality from tracing and Opentracing/OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions to page the team closest to the problem. From a single alerting rule, a set of heuristics can be applied to identify the most probable cause, paging the respective team instead of the alert owner.
       
       The approach enables an effective symptom-based alerting strategy with thresholds derived from the respective operation service level objective.

       Alexander Ananiadis, Bloomberg
       
       Does your platform host applications written by your customers who need to monitor their performance? Is your managed service mission-critical to performance-sensitive clients? Or perhaps your “customers” are actually other teams using your internal platform. Metrics and monitoring systems usually give us insight into the performance of our own services, but giving data directly to users – both internal and external – can help them detect and solve problems on their own, increasing their satisfaction and reducing the support load on our teams.
       
       We will explore different methods for providing users and customers with this direct level of visibility and discuss which approaches make sense in different real-world scenarios, along with some common challenges and pitfalls.

       In the Digital Age we don’t know what we don’t know until we do something and get feedback.
       
       So, how do we build that feedback loop? Many organisations have Data divisions focused on business and customer reporting, but they lack a connection back to engineering. What if we extended the scope of observability to include that missing feedback loop? What if we treated our business objectives, customer outcomes, and engineering maturity as things that we monitor continually and in real-time (just like our technology)?
       
       In this talk I explore the bringing together of BI and observability into something new, which I’m calling “bigger picture observability“ for lack of a better term. Something that provides a compass for organisations to navigate the ocean of chaos we call the Digital Age.

       Ignat Korchagin, Cloudflare
       
       Did you know that Linux has a keystore ready to be used by any application or service? Applications can securely store and share credentials and keys, sign and encrypt data, negotiate a common secret - all this by never touching a single byte of the underlying cryptographic material.
       
       This is especially useful in cloud-native environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other. But if a network-facing service also has some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys.
       
       On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore integrates with security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a single entry point for applications to obtain their secrets.

       - The keystore uses a well-defined system call interface to access and manage keys.
       - Keys can be stored in keyrings, which can be shared between processes or have specific access permissions.
       - Different types of keys, such as user keys and logon keys, serve different purposes and have different access restrictions.
       - The keystore can automatically destroy keys when the associated process or keyring is terminated.
       - The keystore can be used as a building block for more sophisticated key management systems, such as encrypted keys and trusted keys.
       - Trusted keys can utilize a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) for additional security.
       - The keystore interface allows for the integration of external key storage backends, such as cloud HSMs, through a helper program.[0m

       Making secrets both available and secure in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment is a challenging endeavor. How should you balance the security of the system that stores your secrets? What system(s) should you even choose?
       
       Confluent is a multicloud SaaS provider that needs to secure hundreds of credentials across multiple clouds. This talk will detail how we created a strategy to store and serve these secrets securely and how we keep the auditors happy. The session outlines the process we took to understand our the needs of our engineers, what options we made available to our team, what controls did we put in place and how did we keep the auditors at bay.

       You're driving a car and like any other it went through crash testing before mass manufacturing and shipment. Now imagine tests were done for each component separately and not the car as a whole. Would you still drive it? Not so sure! The same is true with Load Testing in production. Having them on real-time data is possible and helps you to increase your predictions and business performance. In this talk we will explain how we’ve touched the holy grail - Load Testing in production while minimizing risk and human intervention. We will go over the gains (uptime and predictability) and tradeoffs (risks and costs). We will go over how automating load tests drove a deeper cultural shift by increasing developer confidence in their services, with almost no additional overhead to the developers. And lastly, we will share more info about the service that made it all happen.

[33m0.001s[0m [1mresponse.Data.Output[0m=[36m- Distributed tracing provides visibility into requests flowing through a distributed microservices architecture from start to end to identify bottlenecks and failures.
       - Traces contain spans that represent operations and provide context through tags like duration, name, status code.
       - Traditional sampling rates are low (1-5%) due to storage and CPU costs of collecting all traces. But this risks missing valuable traces.
       - Head-based sampling decides early on whether to collect a trace, risking missing new services/components.
       - Tail-based sampling decides late, after resource usage, risking overhead of collecting traces of known services.
       - The solution uses adaptive sampling combining head and tail based on trace features to balance these risks.
       - Features include operation path, service name, span hostname, status codes, and other spans/tags.
       - Traces are assigned weights based on an inverse function of observed feature frequencies.
       - This gives higher weight to less frequent or new traces/features worth further examination.
       - Traces are clustered based on features and weights to determine sampling thresholds for storage.[0m

It assigns a unique trace ID to each request and collects additional information as tags as the request flows through the various services. The current landscape of distributed tracing employs a random based sampling of 1-5%, which can lead to missing out on valuable traces. To address this, a combination of head and tail based sampling is used, which is adaptive in nature and reacts based on feature vectors. It assigns a weight to each trace based on an inverse function of the occurrence of the feature vectors, and decides on the threshold of whether the trace needs to be stored or not. This approach has improved the accuracy of tracing to more than 80%.[0m

       Andrew Ryan, Meta
       
       Twenty five years ago, when I started as a sysadmin and attended my first USENIX conference (LISA 1998), "SRE" didn't even exist as a field, and the compute infrastructures we supported were far smaller and more localized. Now, SRE is an industry standard job across the world, and SRE's manage massive and extraordinarily capable cloud environments distributed around the globe.
       
       But the pace of technological change is not slowing down: with rapid development in new technologies such as Machine Learning and Large Language Models (e.g. ChatGPT), we can ask ourselves: will SRE still exist 25 years from now, and if so, what will those jobs be like, and what skills will they require? We cannot know the future, but this talk will concentrate on the things that we can know: job and career skills that have served the author well over the years, and cannot be easily -- if ever -- replicated by large volumes of compute power or any foreseeable artificial intelligence.
       
       Using examples from the author's career through the industry, starting from maintaining a handful of systems in small organizations, all the way to the highest engineering ranks of one of the world's largest tech companies, we will discuss what has worked well, what career options are available, and how to keep your job skills relevant in a world that is constantly evolving.

       - SREs come from diverse educational and career backgrounds beyond just computer science. Different perspectives can provide unique problem-solving abilities.
       - Early career opportunities at high-growth startups can provide valuable experience, but not all "rocket ships" succeed.
       - Developing people skills like cooperation, management and mentorship are important for career success beyond just technical abilities.
       - Project skills like planning, risk assessment and incident management are core to the job due to the project-based nature of building automation and reliability systems.
       - Handling pressure during high-stress on-call incidents can be learned through preparation, shadowing others, and gaining experience over time.
       - "Duct tape" solutions may be ugly but effective for keeping systems running, until more proper fixes can be implemented.
       - SRE careers may evolve over time towards roles emphasizing people management, project management or individual technical skills based on interests and organizational needs.
       - Emerging technologies like AI will change but not eliminate SRE jobs. SRE skills remain highly relevant for areas like safety, values alignment, and developing/maintaining new systems.[0m
